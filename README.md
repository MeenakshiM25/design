# design
creational patterns:
   * Singleton - single instnce
   * Factory  
   (abstract&factory method) - create classes dynamically based on input ,abstract the creation part and instantiate classes represented by                                common interface
   * prototype -               used when obj creation is difficult and provided cloned copy 
   * builder -                 used when object cannot be created in a single step 
behavioural patterns:
   * Template Method -         define algorithm of steps but lets it subclasses define impl of those algorithm
   * Intrepreter -             for language, define representation of its grammar ,use it to interpret sentences to another form/language
   * Chain Of Responsibility - have set of objects in the chain.requested is passed to one by one object .object checks if it can handle                                  the request.if so ,handles request otherwise passes control to other objects in the chain
   * Command                 - command encapsulate diff req as object and passes to invoker.invoker doesnt know how to handle it .when it                                  recieves a servce request, passes control to command (command.execute()) and then command passes request to                                reciever which handles request
   * Strategy                - we take changing behavours out and create interface and set of impl and inject those behaviours at runtime                                  using composition
   * State
   * Observer                 - defines one to many dependencies between objs.when state of obj changes ,it updates dependents dynamically
   * Mediator
   * Iterator                 - iterate over set of aggrgate objects (java.lang.iterator)
   * Visitor
   * Memo
structural patterns:
   * Decorator                - attaches additional responsibilites to obj dynamically.
   * Adaptor                  - converts interface of one class to interface of another class reqd by client
   * Facade                   - simplifies an interface.provide unified interface to set of interfaces making it easy for subsystem to be                                   used
   * Composite
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy 
   * Bridge
